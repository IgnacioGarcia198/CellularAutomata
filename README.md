# Cellular Automata
This is an implementation of the cellular automata concept. Here a simple introduction: [link](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/)

According to Stephen Wolfram ( [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) ), some cases like rule 30( [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) ) show an
irreducibly complexity and he sustains that simple computer programs like a cellular automata can model the world more effectively than traditional mathematical methods.

For further details check his book [A New Kind Of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30). It is free of charge.
